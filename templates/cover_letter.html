            <p><strong>[Hiring Manager's Name]</strong></p>
            <p>[Company’s Name]</p>
            <p>[Company’s Address]</p>
            <p>[City, State, ZIP Code]</p>

            <p>Dear [Hiring Manager's Name],</p>

            <p>I am writing to express my interest in the Python Web Developer position at [Company’s Name], as
                advertised. With a solid foundation in Python programming and web development frameworks, combined with
                practical experience in building dynamic web applications and APIs, I am confident in my ability to
                contribute effectively to your team.</p>

            <p>I hold a Master of Philosophy in Physics from Punjab University Lahore, where I developed strong
                analytical and problem-solving skills. My academic background, coupled with my hands-on experience in
                web development, has equipped me with a unique blend of technical expertise and analytical thinking.</p>

            <p>In my previous projects, I have utilized Django and Django Rest Framework to build and deploy robust web
                applications. Notably, I developed an e-commerce platform with features such as social account
                authentication, email and OTP verification, user permissions management, and Stripe payment integration.
                The project also included tracking user behavior through Django cookie sessions. You can explore this
                project <a href="https://osama11111.pythonanywhere.com">here</a> and review the source code on <a
                    href="https://github.com/osamaaslam86004/E-Commrace-5-24-2024.git">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <p>Additionally, I created an API for resume creation, which was integrated with an e-commerce website. This
                project involved implementing token-based authentication using django-rest-framework-simplejwt to ensure
                secure access to API endpoints. The deployed project can be viewed <a
                    href="https://osama11111.pythonanywhere.com">here</a>, and the code is available on <a
                    href="https://github.com/osamaaslam86004/reumse_api-5-24-2024.git">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <p>My skill set includes proficiency in Python, HTML, CSS, and a range of Django libraries such as Twilio,
                SendGrid, Axes, Phonenumber Field, and more. I am also adept at using tools like Django-crispy-forms and
                django-bootstrap5 to enhance the user experience.</p>

            <p>I am particularly excited about the opportunity at [Company’s Name] because of [specific reason related
                to the company or role]. I am eager to bring my technical skills and passion for web development to your
                team and contribute to the innovative projects at [Company’s Name].</p>

            <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background,
                skills, and certifications will be an excellent fit for the Python Web Developer position. Please feel
                free to contact me at osama.aslam.86004@gmail.com or (+92) 3074649892 to schedule an interview.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Osama Aslam</p>
